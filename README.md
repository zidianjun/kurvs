# KURVS metallicity gradients

This repository contains the source code and reduced data cubes that are used in the analysis of Li et al. (2025). KURVS (KMOS Ultra-deep Rotational Velocity Survey) measures the rotation curves of ionised gas in a representative sample of 43 main-sequence star-forming galaxies at $z\sim1.5$. This represents one of the largest sample size to date at this redshift, allowing a comprehensive analysis of the connection between galactic chemical evolution and the kinematics of ionised gas. By including multi-band
observations in the $IZ$, $YJ$, and $H$ bands that enables the simultaneous coverage of many rest-frame optical emission lines.
