# KURVS metallicity gradients

This repository contains the source code and reduced data cubes that are used in the analysis of Li et al. (2025). KURVS (KMOS Ultra-deep Rotational Velocity Survey) measures the properties of a series of rest-frame optical emission lines of ionised gas in a sample of 43 main-sequence star-forming galaxies at $z\sim1.5$ in the $IZ$, $YJ$, and $H$ bands.
